# CV
This repo contains my CV. As of now (5-5-22) this is just beginning. I will add bits to this as I have time. 

The template here is from S.V. Miller's [`stevetemplates`](https://github.com/svmiller/stevetemplates) package. I am specifically using [this](https://github.com/svmiller/svm-r-markdown-templates/blob/master/svm-latex-cv.tex). That is why there is currently a lot of random stuff in it. 

Also this [blogpost](https://www.jungjulie.com/2020/01/12/update-your-cv-in-r-markdown/) from [Julie Jung](https://www.jungjulie.com) is a helpful start.
